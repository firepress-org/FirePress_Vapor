## Why fork this Ghost Theme ?

**Enhancements** — This theme has been enhanced to feature some elements that are not present in the original code. IMHO, these are essential enhancements that are hard to live without:

- **Buttons** (unicorn UI)
- **Icons** (Font Awesome 5)
- **Code Syntax** (highlight.js) 
- **Grid** (great to make pricing table)

**Drop-in replacement** — No special tweaks to do. It will work out of the box.

**Code Injection** — Take a look those snippets in this [Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Code-Injection-Ghost). It’s an easy way to customize your theme.

**Curated** — This theme was carefully selected out of hundreds of Ghost Themes. See more of them in our [curated git collection](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection/tree/master/01_go).
