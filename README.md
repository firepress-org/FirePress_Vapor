## Why fork this Ghost Theme ?

- **Enhancements** — This theme has been enhanced to feature some elements that are not present in the original theme. IMHO, these are essential enhancements that are hard to live without:
	- **Buttons** (unicorn UI)
	- **Icons** (Font Awesome 5)
	- **Code Syntax** (highlight.js) 
	- **Grid** (great to make pricing table)
- **Drop-in replacement** — No special tweaks to do. It will work out of the box.
- **Code Injection** — Take a look those snippets in this [Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Code-Injection-Ghost). It’s an easy way to customize your theme.
- **Curated** — This theme was carefully selected out of hundreds of Ghost Themes. See more of them in our [Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection ](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection/tree/master/01_go) repo, or [by tags on Github](https://github.com/topics/firepress-ghost-theme).


## Features

Minimal and responsive with a focus on typography, *Vapor* is a theme that embodies the core concept of [Ghost](http://ghost.org/) it fades into the background, bringing the focus to your content.

Supports blog and user images; cover images, while supported in the Ghost admin, are not displayed in the theme due to theme's minimal nature and focus on typography.
