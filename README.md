## What is this?

**FirePress Vapor** is a free and responsive Ghost theme (*a template if you prefer*) made for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). 

**Compatibility** — The Ghost’s engine must be: `Ghost >= 2.0.0`.

**What is Ghost?** — Ghost is a software that lets you create your website with a blog. See the [FAQ section](https://play-with-ghost.com/ghost-themes/faq/#what-is-ghost) for more details.


## Live demo

It will be soon part of **play-with-ghost.com** but it’s not available at the moment. [play-with-ghost.com](https://play-with-ghost.com/) is a playground to learn about Ghost. You can see and edit websites made with Ghost. In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign-up!

## Why fork this Ghost Theme ?

**Enhancements** — This theme has been enhanced to feature some elements that are not present in the original code. IMHO, these are essential enhancements that are hard to live without:

- **Buttons** (unicorn UI)
- **Icons** (Font Awesome 5)
- **Code Syntax** (highlight.js) 
- **Grid** (great to make pricing table)

**Drop-in replacement** — No special tweaks to do. It will work out of the box.

**Code Injection** — Take a look those snippets in this [Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Code-Injection-Ghost). It’s an easy way to customize your theme.

**Curated** — This theme is one the few themes that pass our big test. See the curated collection [in this Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection/tree/master/01_go).


## Features
