# FirePress_Vapor


## What is this?

It’s a theme (*a template if you prefer*) for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/).

Ghost is a free and open source website & blogging platform designed to simplify the process of publishing. It’s individual bloggers as well as online publications. You can see Ghost as a CMS (content management system) designed to be better alternative to systems like: *WordPress, Drupal, Medium, Tumblr*, etc.

## Why fork this Ghost Theme ?

**Enhancements** — This theme is an enhanced version of the Ghost Theme **Vapor**. 

These are the essential enhancements I can’t live without:

- **Buttons** (unicorn UI)
- **Icons** (Font Awesome 5)
- **Code Syntax** (highlight.js) 
- **Grid** (great to make pricing table)

**Drop-in replacement** — No special tweaks to do. It will work out of the box.

**Code Injection** — Take a look those snippets in this [Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Code-Injection-Ghost). It’s an easy way to customize your theme.

**Curated** — This theme is one the few themes that pass our big test. See the curated collection [in this Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection/tree/master/01_go).

**Compatibility** — This theme will work on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) >= **1.0**.


## About Vapor 

Minimal and responsive with a focus on typography, *Vapor* is a theme that embodies the core concept of [Ghost](http://ghost.org/) it fades into the background, bringing the focus to your content.

Supports blog and user images; cover images, while supported in the Ghost admin, are not displayed in the theme due to theme's minimal nature and focus on typography.

Fonts embedded via Google Fonts, including Roboto Slab, Merriweather, and Open Sans Condensed.

## Author

In the world of OSS (open source software) most people refer themselves as maintainers. The thing is… I hate this expression. It feels heavy and not fun. I much prefer author.
